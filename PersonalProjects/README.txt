These are a couple personal projects that I have coded outside of school for fun:

MontyHall.m - simple test of the Monty Hall/3-Doors problem

WordleStartingWords.m - compares all of the possible inputs for wordle against the known answer list to determine the best starting word for the NYT game Wordle.
It then stores that information in teh excel spreadsheet WordleBestWords. (UpdatedWordleBestWords is an updated spreadsheet that was created when one of my 
friends asked me if "Soare" was still the best starting word since the answer list had shrunk)
